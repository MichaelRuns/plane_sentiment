        <p> Welcome to my simple Sentiment Analysis Model!
        </h1>
    <p> This model was trained off of airplane reviews with a 3-gram word model.</br>
        The logistic regression is built from scratch, and as such it is a little wonky</br>
        The API is built off of the fastAPI package
